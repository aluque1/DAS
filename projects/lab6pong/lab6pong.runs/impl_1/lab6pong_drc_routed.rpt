2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net dir012_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin xBallRegister.dir_reg_i_1/O, cell xBallRegister.dir_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net dir__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin yBallRegister.dir_reg_i_1/O, cell yBallRegister.dir_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net yBall__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin yBall_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell yBall_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net yLeft_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin yLeft_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell yLeft_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net yRight_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin yRight_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell yRight_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

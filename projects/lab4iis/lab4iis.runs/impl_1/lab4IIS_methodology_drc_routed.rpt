2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.876 ns between countCnt_reg[3]/C (clocked by sysClk) and ldCode_reg/D (clocked by sysClk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on lrckAD relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on lrckDA relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on mclkAD relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on mclkDA relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on sclkAD relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on sclkDA relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on sdti relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sysClk.
Related violations: <none>

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rightFilter/cs_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rightFilter/cs_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rightFilter/cs_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rightFilter/cs_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock

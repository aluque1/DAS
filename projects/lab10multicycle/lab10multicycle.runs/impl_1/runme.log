WARNING: [DRC DPIP-1] Input pipelining: DSP leftFilter/acc_reg input leftFilter/acc_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.

WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP leftFilter/acc_reg multiplier stage leftFilter/acc_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net leftFilter/cs_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin leftFilter/cs_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell leftFilter/cs_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
